NNTP bridge to keep NNTP &amp; Discourse in sync

Primarily used for keeping [CSH Discourse](https://discourse.csh.rit.edu) in sync with the CSH news server.

## Installation

1. Add `https://github.com/sman591/discourse-nntp-bridge.git` [as a plugin](https://meta.discourse.org/t/install-a-plugin/19157)
2. Add `NEWS_HOST`, `NEWS_USERNAME`, and `NEWS_PASSWORD` environment variables to your `app.yml`
3. Rebuild your app: `./launcher rebuild app`
4. Enter the app: `./launcher enter app`
5. Run `rake discourse_nntp_bridge:assign_newsgroups` to assign newsgroups to your already-created categories

## NNTP Communication

The only required environment variable is `NEWS_HOST`. `NEWS_USERNAME` and `NEWS_PASSWORD` are both optional, and at least one of the two must be present in order to send authentication along with NNTP.

Most of the NNTP communication was written by Alex Grant for [CSH WebNews](https://github.com/grantovich/CSH-WebNews), and is used/adapted upon heavily throughout this plugin.
